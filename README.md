# Thesis Project: Forecasting Respiratory Virus Outbreaks with Machine Learning 

- *How can we apply the power of machine learning and deep learning to generate accurate forecasts, even with limited data?*
- *What diverse approaches can we explore to derive meaningful insights from public health data?*

## Project Overview 
- I became familiar with public health data through my lab experience as a data scientist under Dr. Kechna Cadet at the Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University. During this time, I explored how machine learning and deep learning can provide detailed insights into public perception of drug usage. This experience inspired me to select public health data, specifically respiratory virus data from the CDC, for my thesis.
  
- Currently, there is an ongoing medical student strike in South Korea, which poses a serious threat to national public health resources and their availability. This situation highlights the importance of accurate forecasting to better manage and allocate healthcare resources in times of crisis.
